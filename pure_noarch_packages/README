These are some helper bits for constructing a subset of F23 containing only
"pure" noarch packages.  These are packages built from SRPMs that only
produce noarch package output.  SRPMs that produce a mix of noarch and
binary packages are _not_ candidates for this repo.

This is meant to be run against the GA release of F23, not updates.

The script has some hardcoded paths that you will need to adapt to the
details of your local mirror of the F23 GA repo.
